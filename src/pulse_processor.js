   * Reads pulses and sends a new energy notification to the server.
   * Returns a promise that resolves when the notification has successfully been sent to the server.
   * The result will be the total number of events sent (an integer).
   *
   * This method maintains a persistent state using files.
   * data/xxx/processing = pulses that have been read from inbox and not yet sent to server
   * data/xxx/last-incomplete-event.json = the current event that pulses are being added to (the "left-over" from the previous processing round)
   *
   * This method has two scenarios. Either it is continuing from a previously interrupted run,
   * or it is starting a new run.
   *
   * If data/processing already exists, I will process those. This only happens if the
   * whole meter process was shut down in the middle of processing.
   *
   * If data/processing does not already exist (the normal case),
   * I will rename data/inbox to data/processing, and process those.
   *
   * So how does processing work?
   * Well, I go through all pulses in data/processing and put them into energy events
   * (think of each event as a 10 second time bucket, or whatever the eventInterval is).
   *
   * If I had a saved data/last-incomplete-event.json from before, I'll load that into memory and
   * use that as a starting point.
   *
   * An energy event is "complete" when the next energy event is started. That is, when a pulse shows up that
   * is after the endTime of the current event.
   *
   * After going through all pulses in data/processing, all COMPLETE events are bundled into an energy notification
   * and sent to the server. If that call fails (usually due to a shaky network), then we'll just keep retrying.
   *
   * Usually the last few pulses in data/processing will form an INCOMPLETE energy event. That means, in the future
   * a pulse might show up that belongs in that same energy event. So we don't want to send it to the server yet.
   * Instead, we save it in data/last-incomplete-event.json. That way, next time someone calls readPulsesAndSendEnergyNotification(),
   * we'll be able to add more pulses to the same event.
   *
   * From a persistency perspective, there are only two possible outcomes from here - success, or interrupt.
   *
   * A) Success. We managed to process all pulses and send to the server.
   * In that case, data/processing will be gone, and data/last-incomplete-event.json will be updated.
   *
   * B) Interrupt. The meter was shut down in the middle of processing, or while waiting for response from the server.
   * In that case we'll the old data/last-incomplete-event.json from before, and data/processing will be unchanged.
   * So next time readPulsesAndSendEnergyNotification() we'll just redo the whole thing.
   *
   * What happens in the rare case that the energy events actually reached the server, but the meter crashes
   * before getting the response?
   * In that case, yes, readPulsesAndSendEnergyNotification() will resend those energy events next time and the server
   * will receive a duplicate. Hence, the server should be configured to replace existing energy events
   * (= same meterName and endTime) rather than duplicate.
